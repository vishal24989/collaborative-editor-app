Collaborative Document Editor
A real-time, web-based collaborative document editor built with FastAPI, Socket.IO, and SQLite. This application allows multiple users to sign up, create documents, and edit them simultaneously using a simple and robust server-side locking mechanism. The entire application is designed to be deployed seamlessly to AWS EC2 using Docker and an automated startup script.
‚ú® Features
User Authentication: Secure user signup and login system.
Document Management: Users can create, view, and delete their own documents from a personal dashboard.
Real-time Collaborative Editing: Utilizes a "pessimistic locking" model. The first user to type gets an exclusive lock, preventing data conflicts. The lock is automatically released after a period of inactivity.
Persistent Storage: All users, documents, and content are saved in a SQLite database.
Dockerized Deployment: Fully containerized for easy, consistent, and automated deployment.
üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack
Backend: FastAPI
Real-time Communication: Python-SocketIO with AIOHTTP
Database: SQLite
Authentication: Passlib (for password hashing), Python-JOSE (for JWT)
Containerization: Docker
Process Management: Supervisor (within Docker)
Deployment: AWS EC2

üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)
Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine.
Prerequisites
Python 3.12+
Git
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
Generated bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/collaborative-editor-app.git
cd collaborative-editor-app
Use code with caution.
Bash
Create and activate a virtual environment:
Generated bash
# For macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# For Windows
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Use code with caution.
Bash
Install the required dependencies:
Generated bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Use code with caution.
Bash
Initialize the database:
This command creates the docs.db file and all the necessary tables.
Generated bash
python db.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
Run the servers:
You need to run the FastAPI web server and the Socket.IO server in two separate terminals.
Terminal 1 (Socket.IO Server):
Generated bash
python socket_server.py
Use code with caution.
Bash
Terminal 2 (FastAPI Server):
Generated bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
Use code with caution.
Bash
Access the application:
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000.
‚òÅÔ∏è Automated AWS EC2 Deployment
This guide explains how to deploy the application to a free-tier AWS EC2 instance automatically using a startup script.
Part 1: Prerequisites
An AWS Account: You need an active AWS account.
A Public GitHub Repository: Your project code must be in a public GitHub repository. This guide assumes you have already pushed your code.
Part 2: The EC2 User Data Script
This script automates the entire setup process. You will paste this into the User Data field when launching your EC2 instance.
Copy the script below and make one important change:
Generated bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script runs once when the EC2 instance is first launched.

# 1. Update system packages
yum update -y

# 2. Install necessary tools: Git and Docker
yum install -y git docker

# 3. Start the Docker service and enable it to start on reboot
systemctl start docker
systemctl enable docker

# 4. Add the ec2-user to the 'docker' group to run Docker commands without sudo
usermod -a -G docker ec2-user

# 5. Run the deployment steps as the 'ec2-user'
su - ec2-user -c " \
    # !!! IMPORTANT: Replace this URL with your actual public GitHub repository URL !!!
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/collaborative-editor-app.git /home/ec2-user/app; \
    
    # Navigate into the project directory
    cd /home/ec2-user/app; \
    
    # Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile
    docker build -t collaborative-editor .; \
    
    # Run the Docker container in detached mode and map the ports
    docker run -d -p 80:8000 -p 4000:4000 --restart always --name editor-app collaborative-editor; \
"
Use code with caution.
Bash
Part 3: Launching the EC2 Instance
Navigate to the EC2 service in the AWS Console and click "Launch instances".
Name: Give your server a name (e.g., automated-editor-server).
OS Image (AMI): Select "Amazon Linux" (Amazon Linux 2023 AMI is recommended).
Instance Type: Select t2.micro (Free Tier eligible).
Key Pair: Select or create a new key pair. You will need this to SSH into the instance for troubleshooting.
Network Settings (Security Group): This is a critical step. Click "Edit" and configure the following inbound rules:
Type	Protocol	Port Range	Source	Description
SSH	TCP	22	My IP	Allows you to connect securely
HTTP	TCP	80	Anywhere	Allows web traffic to your FastAPI server
Custom TCP	TCP	4000	Anywhere	Allows WebSocket traffic to your Socket.IO server
Advanced Details: Expand this section, scroll down to the "User data" field, and paste the entire script from Part 2.
Click "Launch instance".
Part 4: Accessing and Verifying the Application
Wait for 3-5 minutes for the instance to boot up and for the User Data script to complete.
In the EC2 console, find your instance and copy its Public IPv4 address.
Open http://YOUR_PUBLIC_IP in your browser. You should see the application's login page.
Troubleshooting
If the application isn't working, SSH into your instance and check the logs:
Generated bash
# Connect to your instance
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ec2-user@YOUR_PUBLIC_IP

# Check the User Data script execution log for errors
cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log

# Check if the Docker container is running
docker ps

# If it's running, check its logs for application errors
docker logs editor-app
